# socially-professional
A repository to help boost your Professional social media presence.

# Intro
You have to begin with an Email account since that's what you need to have to sign-up for most services.  You may want to use
a major email provider in case you want to use federated services.

A social media platform should allow you to get a good pulse on the tech community that you're a part of as well as add to the community and become a part of it.  

It should have avenues to get deep, and avenues that allow you to get a heartbeat and catch up quickly with what's new as well as share contributions.

I've added the following must services as a great place to start
